								<p>This was an interesting assignment. I created my own structures, given I was unsure that I could efficiently seek minimum edges
								with any preset library structure. I am aware that I am using more memory than likely necessary throughout this implementation, but
							I believe I nonetheless did relatively well in keeping it efficient. The two versions were intended to be of different degrees of optimality, per
						the assignment guidelines. I realized a slight improvement in runtime, even with the inclusion of the linear heap search in the second version of the algorithm, which seems to indicate that I did okay. 
									In totality, I found this assignment very fun. I have not recieved total confirmation
				  of the correctness of my calculations, but I nevertheless believe this showcase illustrates my involvement with graph/network-based algorithms.</p>
